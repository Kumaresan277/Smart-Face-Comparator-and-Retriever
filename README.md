Smart Face Comparator and Retriever 🎯
A Tkinter-based desktop application that helps you efficiently compare facial features across images in a selected folder, retrieve matching images, and manage them (Copy, Move, Share).
This is my Final Semester Project.

🚀 Features
✅ Select a folder and display images as a gallery.

✅ Select multiple base images for comparison.

✅ Face encoding with caching for optimized performance.

✅ Progressive comparison using optimized matching logic.

✅ Visual progress bar and option to stop comparison.

✅ Retrieve and display all matched images in a new window.

✅ Copy, Move, or Share matched images.

✅ Simple, clean, and user-friendly interface built with Tkinter.

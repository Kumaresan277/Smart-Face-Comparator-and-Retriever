### Smart Face Comparator and Retriever 🎯
- A Tkinter-based desktop application that helps you efficiently compare facial features across images in a selected folder, retrieve matching images, and manage them (Copy, Move, Share).
This is my Final Semester Project.

### 🚀 Features
- ✅ Select a folder and display images as a gallery.

- ✅ Select multiple base images for comparison.

- ✅ Face encoding with caching for optimized performance.

- ✅ Progressive comparison using optimized matching logic.

- ✅ Visual progress bar and option to stop comparison.

- ✅ Retrieve and display all matched images in a new window.

- ✅ Copy, Move, or Share matched images.

- ✅ Simple, clean, and user-friendly interface built with Tkinter.

### 📸 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Tkinter (GUI)
- Pillow (PIL) - Image processing
- face_recognition - Facial feature encoding & comparison
- Threading - For background comparison without freezing the UI
- Shutil - File management (Copy/Move)
